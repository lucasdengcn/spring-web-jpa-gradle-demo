If IntelliJ IDEA does not recognize JDK 21, you can follow these steps to resolve the issue:

Verify JDK installation: Double-check that JDK 21 is correctly installed on your system. Ensure that you have downloaded and installed the JDK package compatible with your operating system. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or adoptopenjdk.net.

Configure JDK in IntelliJ IDEA: Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to File > Project Structure. In the Project Structure dialog, select "SDKs" under "Platform Settings." Click the "+" button to add a new SDK. Browse to the directory where JDK 21 is installed and select it. Click "OK" to add the JDK to IntelliJ IDEA.

Set JDK for the project: In the Project Structure dialog, select "Project" under "Project Settings." On the right side, locate the "Project SDK" dropdown and select JDK 21 from the list. Apply the changes and close the Project Structure dialog.

Check module settings: If you are working with a specific module within your project, ensure that the module is configured to use JDK 21. In the Project Structure dialog, select "Modules" under "Project Settings." Select the relevant module and verify that the module SDK is set to JDK 21.

Refresh the project: Sometimes, IntelliJ IDEA may not automatically detect changes to the JDK. To force a refresh, go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart. Choose the "Invalidate and Restart" option to restart IntelliJ IDEA and clear the caches. After the restart, IntelliJ IDEA should recognize JDK 21.

Update IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure that you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. Newer versions often include updates and improvements related to JDK compatibility. You can check for updates by going to Help > Check for Updates.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and have IntelliJ IDEA recognize JDK 21 properly. If the problem persists, you may need to provide more specific details about the error or consult the IntelliJ IDEA documentation or support resources for further assistance.
